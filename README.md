Blynk is hardware agnostic platform that provides a no code web dashboard and mobile apps for visualization of data, and remote control of any IoT device. &nbsp; Both the native mobile apps for iOS and Android and the web dashboard are built with drag-and-drop widgets, eliminating the need to write code for the front-end. &nbsp; Blynk also includes other tools such as over-the-air (OTA), device provisioning, user management, alerts and notifications, automations, and data analytics. &nbsp; 

## Configuring Blynk Services

In June 2023, Blynk released a new feature called [**Blueprints**](https://blynk.io/blog/meet-blueprints-your-pre-built-iot-solution). &nbsp;  A [blueprint](https://blynk.cloud/dashboard/blueprints/Library) is a pre-built IoT project template that includes a web and mobile dashboard, firmware examples, and a step-by-step tutorial to activate and start using the project. &nbsp;  The blueprint 'particle_device_blueprint' provides firmware for a Particle device, and configures Blynk for bi-directional communication between **any** Particle device and Blynk. &nbsp; 

From the Blynk.Console, navigate to 'Templates' -> 'Blueprints' -> 'Particle Devices'. &nbsp;
